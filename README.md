  ### Tests:
  This application was tested by creating method tests for the Employee, Engineer, Intern, and Manager Classes.  These test were created to check the functionality of the methods used to fetch the information provided by the user (ie. getName(), getEmail, getID(), getRole(), etc.).  All tests we created to purposely fail so that they showed Classes were undefined.  Then when the Classes and their respective Constructors were created, all tests passed!  This ensured me that if I were to encounter any bugs when coding the app, I would be able to find and fix those bugs with ease.  If you need to run the test, make sure you change the "script" so that "test" looks for "jest".
